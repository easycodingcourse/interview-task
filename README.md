# Interview task
### Node Js Test
Letâ€™s assume we have a payment sub-system. This system is supposed to check whether the given validated invoice can get a discount or not.

**In this test we need an endpoint as follows:**


**Input:** product code or product name, the user's ID and the invoice final amount..

**Response**: If it includes the discount, the discount percentage that can be considered for the given invoice..


Applying the discount:
If the product has a discount this discount has a priority and will be returned. Otherwise, we move to its parent category (if it exists) and check if it has a discount and so on until the product-category chain is done. If no discount was found the API should return -1.

For simplicity, you can only consider 2 layers of this structure and we have one product from one category, Which is this category is another subset of categories
